Version 1 - 05-05-2024:
- Initial release.
- Changes from original CoronaAI:
    - Selecting vehicles:
        - Will make sure to pick a passenger road vehicle that can run on the default road type (i.e. not a tram). If none can be found, the AI will not build anything but will wait until one is available.
        - Will pick the road vehicle with the highest passenger capacity.
    - Building stations, depots and buses:
        - Ensure that the company actually built them on the chosen tiles (no matter the road type).
        - Ensure that a depot was built before trying to buy a bus.
        - Ensure that a bus was bought.
        - Ensure stations and depots are connected to each other by existing roads.
        - Don't build outside of the current town's local authority (which can cause issues if a big town is next to a small town).
    - Removing unused stations and depots:
        - Try again later if the operation was unsuccessful (e.g. another company's vehicle was in the way).
        - Only try to remove them if both stations are unused (see limitations).
    - On AI start, will attempt to look for existing stations, depots and buses (so that it does not rebuild everything again when loading a saved game).
    - After going through all towns, will wait a year before going through them again to (re)build in towns that currently have no service.
    - Finances:
        - Will repay the loan if there's enough spare money.
        - Will take out a loan (if it doesn't have one already) if running low on money.
        - Will sell any unprofitable vehicles (rather than just highly unprofitable) when running low on money and if the loan is at maximum.
    - Replacing old vehicles:
        - On AI start, turn off auto-renew to not interfere with sending old vehicles to the depot (which would lead to depots full of auto-renewed vehicles).
        - Do not try to sell old vehicles if there's no available replacement (and any in depots already will be sent back out).
        - If buying a replacement vehicle fails for the last vehicle on the route, keep the old vehicle around until it can be replaced (if it can).

Version 2 - 12-05-2024:
- Will not take out a loan at game start if not needed (i.e. when loading a game and it's already repaid the loan).
- Multiple instances will have a numbered company name.
- If a service is removed because it was unprofitable, will not attempt to rebuild the service for at least five years.
- Will not attempt to clone buses if low on money.

Version 3 - 17-06-2024:
- Added four parameters, which control:
    - How often the company will run through all towns to check and build infrastructure, in years.
    - How long to wait when a service is removed for being unprofitable before rebuilding it, also in years.
    - The length of time between build actions, in days.
    - The criteria for choosing a new vehicle: Highest capacity (default), newest, fastest, most reliable, cheapest and randomly chosen.
- Time gap between checks of towns:
    - Is now measured from the start of the process, rather than the end, for consistency.
    - Accounts for if the process ran over the specified number of years.
    - Uses economic periods if running in wallclock timekeeping mode.
    - Accounts for leap years if running in calendar timekeeping mode.
- Uses Road.Pathfinder version 4 rather than 3.
- Will pick a random secondary colour for the company when it is started, so that it can be a bit more colourful with 2cc NewGRFs.

Version 4 - 08-09-2024:
- Now supports saving and loading. The next scheduled check on town infrastructure, and the data on towns will be saved.
