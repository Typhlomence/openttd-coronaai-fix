# CoronaAI Fix (openttd-coronaai-fix)
CoronaAI is a simple AI that attempts to build bus services in all cities on the map. The original version by Libor Vilimek works well enough, but has a few small bugs which I've elected to fix with this fork, without increasing the complexity by too much.

This is my first work on an AI (or any modification for OpenTTD), so there's probably implementation details that can be improved.

Changes from the original CoronaAI:
* (To be completed) 

# Original readme of ottd-coronaai
Please increase number of road vehicles per company (in settings -> limitations).
On 1024x1024 map the preffered number is 2500.

 * This is very simple AI that was written while I was ill due to having covid-19.
 * I spent only two partial days working on it, therefore it really is intended to be simple.
 * It will try to spread to all cities with buses alone.
